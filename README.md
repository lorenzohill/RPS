## Project Overview
We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. If you don’t know what that is check the Wikipedia article or this ridiculous step-by-step. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text, so don’t forget to keep the code on GitHub! You might notice some ‘Live Preview’ links in the student solutions that have a GUI - this is coming in a later lesson. When you get there don’t forget to come back and add your link!

## How to play
1. Open JS Console.
2. Click on the purple play button to bring up a prompt window. 
3. Type the item you would like to throw. This is not case senitive.
4. Check if you win, lose or tie in console.
